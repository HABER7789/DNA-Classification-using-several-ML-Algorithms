# DNA-Classification-using-several-ML-Algorithms
Classifying DNA into respective attributes and Imputing missing data, with best Model Selection
- The project involves preparing the imported dataset that will be feeded to the machine learning models.
- The project also splits the dataset into respective training and testing data before proceeding to its classfication.
- After splitting the dataset, the project imports several machine learning algorithms such as KNeighbor Classifier, MLP Classifier, GaussianProcess Classifier, DecisionTree Classifier and a few others, that will classify the DNA dataset.
- All machine learning models will have a classfication report revealing the accuracy for each one of them.
